## Title
JARVIS: A Multifunctional Virtual Assistant

## Overview
JARVIS is an advanced virtual assistant designed to streamline various tasks such as providing weather updates, controlling music playback, managing tasks, translating languages, integrating Whatsapp, Instagram, Youtube, and more. The project incorporates state-of-the-art Audio techniques to deliver an intuitive and efficient user experience.

## Description
The JARVIS project aims to create a versatile virtual assistant that leverages advanced technologies to perform a wide range of functions. These functions include media playback control, opening different applications, accessing emails, setting alarm, getting information about current affairs, checking time and temperature. The assistant is designed to be highly interactive and user-friendly, making use of both voice commands and gesture recognition.

## Features
- **Weather Updates**: Provides real-time weather information.
- **Music Control**: Manages music playback through voice commands.
- **Task Scheduling**: Allows users to schedule and manage tasks.
- **Translation**: Translates text between multiple languages.
- **setting alarm**: Set an alarm for our use
- **Internet Speed**: Check internet speed with just asking Jarvis
- **News**: Ask Jarvis about latest news and current affairs in the world
- **Calculator**: Use it as a Calculator

## Steps for Approach
1. **Define Objectives**: Outline the specific functions and capabilities of JARVIS.
2. **Research and Development**: Conduct research on NLP, machine learning, and relevant technologies along with genAI.
3. **Design System Architecture**: Create a comprehensive design for the system's architecture.
4. **Implement Core Functions**: Develop the core functionalities such as weather updates, music control, and task scheduling.
5. **Integrate Advanced Features**: Incorporate advanced features like gesture recognition and semantic analysis.
6. **Testing and Refinement**: Conduct thorough testing and refine the system based on feedback and performance metrics.

## KPIs
- **Response Time**: Evaluate the system's response time to user commands.
- **User Satisfaction**: Gather user feedback to assess satisfaction with the assistant's performance.
- **Task Completion Rate**: Track the rate at which scheduled tasks are completed successfully.
- **Translation Accuracy**: Measure the accuracy of the translation function.

## Implementation
1. **Weather Updates**: Integrated using APIs like OpenWeatherMap.
2. **Music Control**: Implemented using media player APIs and PyAutoGUI for hand gesture control.
3. **Task Scheduling**: Developed using task management libraries and APIs.
4. **Translation**: Utilized translation APIs such as Google Translate API.
